# Contributing

Lets contribute for the future!

## Quick checklist
1. Make sure your entry is something **you have personally read/used and can recommend**.
2. Follow the format:
   `- [Name](URL) – 30‑60 characters of description.`
3. Keep the list alphabetically sorted within each section.
4. Run `npm run lint` locally to ensure **awesome‑lint** passes.
5. Submit a pull request that:
   - Adds your link at the correct place.
   - Updates no more than one or two lines unrelated to your change.
   - Has a clear title like `Add Foo Bar`.
   - Mentions **agent** in the PR body to show you have read the guidelines.
6. Review at least **two** other open PRs in this repository (required for our eventual upstream submission).
